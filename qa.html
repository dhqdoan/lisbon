            <p>
                <strong>Do I need a passport?</strong><br />
                Yes, you will need your passport for this trip!
                Please make sure yours is not expired and will not be within 6 months of traveling.            
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>What will the weather be like?</strong><br />
                August is the warmest month of the year in Lisbon. The average temperature is 83°F / 65°F. It is hot, sunny and dry during the daytime,
                with very little chance of rain. We recommend bringing a fan, a hat, and some sunscreen!
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Will they speak English in Lisbon?</strong><br />
                We will be staying in the heart of downtown Lisbon — a very tourist-friendly area. Almost everyone will speak English.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Will my phone work in Portugal?</strong><br />
                Check with your carrier for their international rates. If you have an unlocked mobile phone, we recommend an app called Airalo for
                purchasing a plan with a local carrier.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Do I need cash?</strong><br />
                The majority of the restaurants and stores in downtown Lisbon take credit card (Visa and Mastercard, not always Amex) and we recommend checking to make sure your card doesn't charge exchange fees. If you do need cash, Multibanco ATMs are prevalent throughout the airport and the city.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Can we bring our kids?</strong><br />
                Only children of our families members are included in our celebrations. For our friends, you are certainly welcome to bring your kids to Portugal. Babysitting services are available:<br />

            <h2>Other Tips for Traveling to Portugal</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Couvert:</strong><br />
                This is the Portuguese custom of bringing small appetizers to the table at the beginning of a meal like bread, butter, olives, cheese, etc. These are not free.
                They are often delicious and worth the few euros you'll pay for them (price will be on the menu). If you don't want them, simply decline when they are brought
                to the table or don't eat them if they are already sitting on your table.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Tipping:</strong><br />
                Tipping in Portugal is generally not expected. If you choose to do so, a tip of 5 to 10% is sufficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Eating late:</strong><br />
                In Portugal, it's very common for people to eat dinner late in the evening, so restaurants often don't open until 7pm or 8pm.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>High season:</strong><br />
                The month of August is peak travel season for all of Europe. For restaurants or activitites that may book up, it's best to make reservations as early as possible.
